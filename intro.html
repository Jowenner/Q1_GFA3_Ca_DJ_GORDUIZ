                <h1>Qualitative Variables</h1>
                <p>The two qualitative variables chosen for this project are gender and self-rating. This is because we, my team, intended
                    to isolate the results for male and for female as well as both genders combined to clearly see the results and draw better
                    conclusions for it. As for self-rating, this is used as additional information to see whether the number of hours in the Internet
                    affects and grades from last year affect their confidence in their completion on the academic journey.

                <h1>Quantitative Variables</h1>
                <p>
                    The two quantitative variables chosen for this project are hours used on the internet and grades from last year. This is because 
                    by using these two variables, we can draw a relationship between them and make a good conclusion as well as a solution to problems
                    commonly related to these two variables.
